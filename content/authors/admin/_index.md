I am a Master's student at the University of Chile, interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Data Science. My Master's thesis is about developing a set of theoretical and practical tools to allow us to extract an approximation, as a human-readable logical formula, of the function a GNN (Graph Neural Network) represents, and use that formula as an explanation of the GNN.

My experience consists mostly of research on uses of Machine Learning on source code and research on Graph Neural Networks, I have also implemented various prototypes for freelance and research projects. This ranges from EDA and feature and data engineering, to software development and data visualization.
I also have experience in teaching as a TA for several courses in University, ranging from advanced programming methodology classes to data mining and deep learning. Currently I am working as a TA for the following courses: Deep Learning, Introductory Data Mining and Data Science Project.

When not in front of my computer I am reading, studying Japanese Kanji, or building mechanical keyboards. I also love rhythm games.
